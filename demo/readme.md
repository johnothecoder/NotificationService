# JohnoTheCoder\NotificationService Demo

This is just a quick demo on how I foresaw the implementation of the Notification Service into a working environment. You'll see that none of the clases here really do anything, it's just for reference.

For reference the company is `AcmeCorp` and as such all of the classes within `src` of this directory are namespaced to that end. You can see here how you can specify namespaces for certain things so that you can modify your own implementation to fit your own PSR-4 namespaces, assuming fully qualified namespaces. If you leave the namespace blank I will assume every class you're referring to is within the root namespace.
