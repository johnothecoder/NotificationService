# Notification Service

This is a quick, open source (GNU public license) notification service just to take some of the pain out of implementation. I've implemented a notification service similar to this a couple of times in the past and have use for it in a few project currently.

The idea is that it provides a design and a quick and easy set of classes and interfaces which one can use so they just need to build in their own providers and notification types.

Hopefully the code and usage will be somewhat self explanatory, but I will draw up some documentation soon.

It's free for any usage you want; use/change/modify/extend it as you see fit. I accept no responsibility for anything in here though, and to that end the license is at the bottom of this readme file.

Within `src` is the collection of classes. Within `demo` is an example of how I intend on implementing it in my own projects.
